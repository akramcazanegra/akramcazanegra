 Hi, I’m @akramcazanegra
👀 I’m interested in web development, software engineering, and exploring new technologies.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Python techniques and diving deeper into Laravel.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Laravel, Bootstrap, and Java.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him
⚡ Fun fact: I once created a web app that integrates all my favorite tech stacks into one seamless experience!
